## Move across seamlessly

Have a mod, or another application pointing to the directory? Can't remember? You can move a folder, without 
changing its path so any dependent applications will still function as normal.

## Keep track

(TO BE DONE) Keep track of the folders you've linked, and make sure that you haven't forgotten about some folder
nested deep somewhere.

## Be productive

(TO BE DONE) Want to move multiple at once? Queue them up and sit back while Cargoshift does the work. You can
configure the concurrency level, as well as the thread count for the copy.
